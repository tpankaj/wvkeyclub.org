	    I’m Michael Zhang, WVKC’s 2013-2014 President. I’ve been a part of Key Club since freshman year, and have enjoyed every minute. Previously the club’s webmaster, I’ve been focused on inspiring greater involvement from YOU, the people that make this club great. Whether it's a community run, Fall Rally or a festival, I always look forward to seeing our members dedicate themselves to service and even take on roles of leadership. I’m super excited for the year ahead; it’s full of opportunities to grow Key Club, from our divisional involvement, to our member count or our fundraising total. I’m always open to feedback, so feel free to send me an email or Facebook message if you have any suggestions or problems! I’m looking forward to the year ahead!

	    Hi! I'm Iris, and I have officially crept from my position as Treasurer to the position of your Vice President for the 2013 - 2014 KC year. How glorious! I've been a dedicated member/officer since freshman year, accumulating 300 hours since. From simple elementary school festivals to California-Nevada-Hawaii's District-wide Convention, my passion to serve not only the community, but you guys as members has only grown&hellip;exponentially. In the past two years, my experience serving on both the Appointed and Executive Board has opened my eyes to the magic that happens behind-the-scenes--whether it’s staying up until 2am to find just one more volunteer opportunity, or communicating with our division-district liaisons to plan the perfect bake-sale, the hard work that's put into Key Club from members &amp; officers alike truly redefines the word "service". Outside of volunteering, I love Photobooth, bananas, and rhythmic gymnastics. I am also a huge advocate of Starbucks’ White Chocolate Mocha Frappuccinos, so do me a favor and try one please. Aside from everything, I cannot wait to see our club grow even more this year, and I hope, sometime in the next 12 months, that you will find your passion to serve. :) This is just the beginning.
