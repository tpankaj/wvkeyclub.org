	    I'm Michael Zhang, WVKC's 2013-2014 President. I've been a part of Key Club since freshman year, and have enjoyed every minute. Previously the club's webmaster, I've been focused on inspiring greater involvement from YOU, the people that make this club great. Whether it's a community run, Fall Rally or a festival, I always look forward to seeing our members dedicate themselves to service and even take on roles of leadership. I'm super excited for the year ahead; it's full of opportunities to grow Key Club, from our divisional involvement, to our member count or our fundraising total. I'm always open to feedback, so feel free to send me an email or Facebook message if you have any suggestions or problems! I'm looking forward to the year ahead!

	    Hi! I'm Iris, and I have officially crept from my position as Treasurer to the position of your Vice President for the 2013 - 2014 KC year. How glorious! I've been a dedicated member/officer since freshman year, accumulating 300 hours since. From simple elementary school festivals to California-Nevada-Hawaii's District-wide Convention, my passion to serve not only the community, but you guys as members has only grown&hellip;exponentially. In the past two years, my experience serving on both the Appointed and Executive Board has opened my eyes to the magic that happens behind-the-scenes&mdash;whether it's staying up until 2am to find just one more volunteer opportunity, or communicating with our division-district liaisons to plan the perfect bake-sale, the hard work that's put into Key Club from members &amp; officers alike truly redefines the word "service". Outside of volunteering, I love Photobooth, bananas, and rhythmic gymnastics. I am also a huge advocate of Starbucks' White Chocolate Mocha Frappuccinos, so do me a favor and try one please. Aside from everything, I cannot wait to see our club grow even more this year, and I hope, sometime in the next 12 months, that you will find your passion to serve. :) This is just the beginning.

	    I'm Lily Vo and I'm Westview Key Club's 2013-2014 Secretary. I've been a dedicated Key Clubber since Freshman year; holding positions such as Freshman and Sophomore Director. As my first year as an executive board member, I am honored to be sharing another unforgettable Key Club year with my fellow friends and peers. With two years of experience on the board, I am ready to move one step further to fulfill my role as Secretary and the responsibilities and duties that entails. My Key Club passion sparked at the CNH District Convention in Anaheim 2013. What was once a passive, obligatory attitude to wake up at the crack of dawn and pass out t shirts and water cups became an obsession, a new profound love to all things Key Club. I began going to divisional events, meeting and collaborating with people who share the same love and dedication to Key Club, and offered my time and effort to the community on a much larger scale. My goal is to help you discover your Key Club "spark". The spark that will allow you to experience all the same, hopefully even more, experiences I am fortunate enough to hold close to my heart. Make the most out of your next Key Club year and welcome to our crazy, but energetic, ohana!

	    Hello, I'm Shaoxiong Liu and I am your 2013-2014 Key Club Treasurer. Since the due date for the biography was some day in April, I obviously couldn't finish. I also blame Alex Zhang for starting the Bio System. I would like to start off by challenging each and everyone one of YOU to find a way to serve and to give back to the community to create change. Do not be afraid to attend events just because you are scared because you do not know anyone who is going. We are all one big family and even a complete stranger can turn into a great friend in just a few moments time. I do also encourage everyone to attend divisional events as you get to meet many new people from other schools.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Outside of Key Club, I enjoy browsing the internet, swimming, and pursuing my hobby of photography. In the upcoming year, be on the lookout for a lot more fundraisers and fun events to get you more involved. If you ever have any suggestions or ideas for fundraisers please feel free to contact me as I am completely open to new and exciting ideas. I look forward to a great year! Last but not least, KEY CLUBBERS, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

If you're interested in joining me on these meetings to also get updates, contact me! I've been in Key Club since Freshman year and I've enjoyed the spirit of being a Red Bull while being able to volunteer! Volunteering has always taught me so much, and I've been able to experience its amazing inpact through Key Club. Besides Key Club, I enjoy being in advanced choir and piano. Music is very important to me because it has always brought a new view to everything in my life while helping me better experience my life. I am very dedicated to my studies; especially my math and science classes. I've always loved broadening my knowledge in school. My hobbies include singing, drawing, and cubing! I am really excited to serve in the appointed board this coming year, and I look forward to sparking the Red Bull spirit in all of our members!

	    Hey Key Clubbers! I'm James Doan and I'm your Assistant Treasurer for the 2013-2014 year. I'm currently a senior and joined Key Club during my junior year. Despite my relatively short time in Key Club, I already established relationships with many of the people in Key Club since I joined. I personally love the quirky and optimistic attitudes of our Key Club family. I enjoy volunteering because you get to meet new people, help the community, and learn unique/valuable skills (I've learned things from making shaved ice and boba to operating computers). I really love volunteering at local festivals and organized runs because of the exuberant atmosphere and excitement they provide. Some other clubs I'm involved in at Westview are Engineering Club, ABE, Ping Pong Club, and 3D Design. In my spare time I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, eating, and swimming. Feel free to contact me via Facebook or email regarding anything. Let's make this a memorable and exciting year Key Club!

As a sophomore soon to be junior, I can honestly say that volunteering has had a huge impact on my life throughout high school and I hope that it continues to do so as the years go on. Aside from volunteering, I enjoy baking, running, and reading (preferably not 50 Shades of Grey). I look forward to what the next year has in store and I hope to serve you all to the best of my abilities as your assistant secretary!

My job is to reel in sophomores to join out club! :D I'm bubbly and loud (warning: cover your ears) but it helps when you're cheering people on in events such as runs! :3 I joined key club freshman year, scared of how to interact with high school people and get to know them. Turns out, key club was the best place to interact! Everyone is friendly, energetic, and always "feels good" xD I love k-pop, dramas, and Pokemon/Digimon (yes, your typical Asian kid xD) My favorite avenger is hawk guy and iron man (just cuz hawk guy's hot and Robert Downey jr. Is amazing xD). If you need help, just contact me! I'm often on Facebook and with my phone. :) But never ask me about directions or geography.... I'm more likely to get lost than you are x3

If you really need to know, I am a Ho, along with Lily Ho. In my family of four, I have a little brother that is going to be a freshman next year (do not worry I shall force him to join Key Club). I used to have 3 pet finches but one died after the other two killed her. The other two died after I forgot to feed them. I also used to have a pet cat called Lucky, but we gave her to my aunt. I participated in Science Olympiad and it's fun I swear. As a part of Key Club, I participated in many service projects, including the many runs that we have advertised and the elementary schools that we visit. I look forward to a great 2013-2014 school year and hope for the best for all of us. Here is a very derpy picture of me. Tishmal. #YOLOSWAG420BLAZEITFAGGOTALLDAYERRYDAYBAYLYFE69MOFO

	    Yo dawg, I'm Kenneth Huang, and I heard I needed a biography so I wrote you one. Now I could really be playing League of Legends with the Challenger Tier, Jiali Huang, but I'm writing this fancy biography to give you a brief overview of your 2013-2014 Historian. I'm a descendent from the Huang Dynasty and Jiali Huang was the previous Emperor Historian who is now our 2012-2013 alumni. Jiali has been able to teach me how to use the camera, so hopefully I will be able to put these skills to use at Key Club event. Alright, so I started Key Club around September and I believed that this club was the only way to get quick hours without dying of boredom. Even if some events are lackluster, just being with my friends and having some fun helping the community is enough. I love volunteering and receiving free shirts, free swag bags, and free food. As your historian I will look forward to taking many pictures of all your sexy faces, as long as you peeps don't avoid the camera like certain members D:<. Anyways that wraps up my biography, Challenger tier, here I come! #yoloswag #latenightcrew.
